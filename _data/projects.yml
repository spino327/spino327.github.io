# Projects

- title: texwatch.sh
  url: https://github.com/spino327/texwatch.sh
  description: "A daemon that watch for changes in latex files and recompiles them if it detects a change. It works great if you edit latex files in Vim or other editor without built-in for visualization."

- title: sourcing_tool
  url: https://github.com/spino327/sourcing_tool
  description: "Simple bash-based tool to source user-defined environments. Sometimes you need to use different libraries or applications, and potentially you need different versions of those. It can become a mess if you are working on different projects that use different versions of compilers/libraries/... One solution is to use tools like modules or valet, but I don't have time to configure a complex environment management software."

- title: Training Fraud detection in Hadoop
  url: https://github.com/spino327/training_fraud_detection_hadoop
  description: "On-Line Fraud Detection involves identifying a fraud as soon as it has been perpetrated into the system. This technique is only successful by having a training algorithm that can produce a model suitable to be used by a real-time detector. In this project, we will focus on fraud detection for credit card transactions using Markov chains to train the model off-line and a parallel implementation of a concurrent queue for on-line detection."

- title: NAS NPB OpenACC_2.5
  url: https://github.com/spino327/NAS_SHOC_OpenACC_2.5
  description: "Code repository for the benchmarks discussed in our paper 'Exploring translation of OpenMP to OpenACC 2.5: Lessons Learned'. This paper explores the similarities and the functionality gaps between both models and presents insights into the translation process of constructs from OpenMP to OpenACC."
