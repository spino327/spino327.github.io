Iâ€™m a Master student in the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at the University of Delaware. I have worked on several projects ranging from distributed heterogeneous systems, Big Data, and communications, where I have analyzed, designed, and developed strategies and solutions to various challenging problems. 

<!--My experience in different projects has allowed me to acquire skills directly related to software engineering practices, using different programming languages, and in other areas such as distributed computing, machine learning, ....-->

I have had the fortune to work with the following distinguished professors and scientists while at University of Delaware:

* Dr. Sunita Chandrasekaran in the Computational Research and Programming Lab (CRPL).  
* Dr. Lori Pollock in the Software Analysis and Compilation Research Lab.  
* Dr. Guang Gao in the Computer Architecture and Parallel Computing Lab.  
* Dr. Kristina Winbladh in the Software Engineering Lab.  

### Interests:

* Compilers and Runtime Software Technologies.
* Parallel Programming and Big data.
* Software Engineering.
