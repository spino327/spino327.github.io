This post have some recurrent tips that I use in vim.

## Using splits

* `ctr+w ctr+w (normal mode)` jump to the next split

## Using tabs

For more go to <a target="null" href="http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Using_tab_pages">Using tab pages at vim.wikia</a>.

* `:tabedit {file}` edit the file in a new tab.
* `:tabclose {i}` close the i-th tab
* `:tabclose` close the current tab
* `:tabs` list the current tabs
* `:tabn` go to next tab
* `:tabp` go to previous tab
* `gt (normal mode)` go to next tab
* `gT (normal mode)` go the previous tab

## General

* `:set list` helpful when mantaining code format (using tabs or spaces). It displays unprintable characters with '^' and put '$' after each line.

## NERD tree

* `:NERDTree` toggle the file navigator or focus on it.

## Vimrc

I used the awesome version of <a target="null" href="https://github.com/amix/vimrc">The Ultimate vimrc</a>. It comes with a lot of batteries included such as pathogen and NERD tree.
