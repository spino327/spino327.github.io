This post have some recurrent tips that I use with git.

## Moving files/folders

When you need to move or rename a file/folder that is in a git repository, then you'll need to take special care (more than using `mv`). The original information was taken from [Rename files and folders with git](http://www.patrick-wied.at/blog/rename-files-and-folders-with-git)

### How to..
We'll use `git mv <source> <destination>` to rename a folder/file. Assuming we have the folder *my_folder* and we'd like to rename it to *the_folder* then:
{% highlight bash %}
# move the folder/file with git mv
git mv my_folder the_folder
# add the changes to the index and commit them after renaming with git mv.
git add -u the_folder 
git commit -m "renaming my_folder to the_folder"
{% endhighlight %}

The option *-u* in `git add` will update the index for already tracking files. This removes as well as modifies index entries to match the working tree, but adds no new files.
